TASK 1
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
• The Iris flower dataset encompasses three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and
virginica.
• These species are discernible through specific measurements. Imagine possessing
measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their distinct species.
• The goal is to train a machine learning model capable of learning from these
measurements and proficiently categorizing Iris flowers into their corresponding
species.
• Employ the Iris dataset to construct a model adept at classifying Iris flowers into
distinct species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
• This dataset serves as a prevalent choice for initial classification tasks, making it
ideal for introductory learning experiences

TASK 2
CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
• Develop a machine learning model designed to detect fraudulent credit card
transactions.
• The process involves preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, addressing
class imbalance concerns, and partitioning the dataset into training and testing
subsets.
• Train a classification algorithm—like logistic regression or random forests—to
differentiate between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
• Assess the model's efficacy using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
• Additionally, explore strategies like oversampling or undersampling to enhance
outcomes and refine the model's performance

TASK 3
TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
• Utilize the Titanic dataset to construct a predictive model determining if a
passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
• This project serves as an introductory exercise, offering accessible data for analysis.
• The dataset comprises passenger details encompassing age, gender, ticket class,
fare, cabin, and survival outcome.
• By applying this data, you can embark on a classic project that provides insights
into survival patterns among Titanic passengers

TASK 4
SUPERSTORE SALES PREDICTION
• Time series analysis deals with time series based data to extract patterns for
predictions and other characteristics of the data.
• It uses a model for forecasting future values in a small time frame based on
previous observations.
• It is widely used for non-stationary data, such as economic data, weather data,
stock prices, and retail sales forecasting

TASK 5
CAR PRICE PREDICTION
• Numerous factors contribute to a car's price, encompassing brand reputation, car
features, horsepower, mileage efficiency, and more.
• Car price prediction stands as a significant domain within machine learning
research.
• If you seek to master the art of training a car price prediction model, this project
presents a valuable learning opportunity

TASK 6
CINEMA TICKETS
• The Cinema Tickets dataset, covering eight months in 2018, offers sales history and
screening details from various cinemas. Ideal for predictive modeling, it supports
forecasting, screening optimization, and ROI improvement. With anonymized
locations, it aids decisions on cast, crew, and project planning.
• Emphasizing time series analysis, it provides insights for Cinema Clustering, sales
forecasts, and movie genre recommendations. Evolving with additional movie
data, it enhances strategic decision-making in the cinema industry

TASK 7
SHOPPER SENTIMENTS
• The ShopperSentiments dataset, comprising over 250,000 customer reviews on
TeePublic, provides key insights for online fashion retail. Attributes include
reviewer_id, store_location, date, title, review, and review-label (rating 1 to 5).
• With unique features like geospatial coordinates and temporal data, it's a valuable
resource for sentiment analysis, geospatial patterns, temporal trends, and review
categorization.
• TeePublic's diverse fashion collection is the backdrop for understanding customer
sentiments and preferences.

TASK 8
FAKE NEWS PREDICTION
• The Fake News Prediction Dataset features both real and fake news, providing a
basis for predictive modeling to identify misinformation. With columns including
Title, Text, and Label (Fake or Real), it addresses the pervasive issue of false or
misleading information in news.
• The dataset supports efforts to enhance information integrity, combat fake news,
and promote media literacy.
